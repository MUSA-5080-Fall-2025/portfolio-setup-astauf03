### Key Concepts Learned  
Summary statistics is useful for investigating patterns.
ACS data contains surplus of errors, planners fail to report them. 

### Coding Techniques
- ggplot(data)
- aes(x, y,...)
- geom_points(colors, size, decorate)

### Questions & Challenges
Is kable() mainly for a quick, but comprehensible way to represent a summary analysis?

### Connections to Policy
Planners should report MOEs because it affects minorities and at the end of the data, is inaccurate and misleading. 

### Reflection
- Playing with ACS data seems like a great way to feel more confident with R and basic data dissemination.
